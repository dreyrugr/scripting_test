Script is short and simple.

There is likely a better way to strip the quotes and replace teh commas with spaces, but I was able to capture all the data with one line then clean it up to the proper format.

Syntax to run this script is:
./problem2.sh

Script cleans up temp file.  If you want to view it, comment the last line in the script to prevent removal.
