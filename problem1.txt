Parse the two SYSCONFIG-A files in the data folder.
Extract the following:
* System Serial Number
* Model Name (A model name will start with FAS and have 4 numbers after it)  
* Extract the name of each PCI card in each slot.  Ignore items in slot 0, as those are on the motherboard.
* Extract the number of disks on each port.  
  A disk adapter port looks something like this (the port number is 7a)
	slot 7: FC Host Adapter 7a (LSI Logic 949E rev. A.1, L-port, <UP>)   
  An example disk looks like this:
	 16  : NETAPP   X276_FAL9E288F10 NA05 272.0GB 520B/sect (DH07P790548K)

The input to the script should be the name of the SYSCONFIG-A file.  
The output of the script should be JSON format.  It should have properties for the model name and serial number, and lists for 
 each PCI card and a list of ports that have disks and the quantity of disks on each of those ports.
